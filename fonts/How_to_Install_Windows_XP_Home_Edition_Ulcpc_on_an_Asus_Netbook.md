In this article, we will show you how to install Windows XP Home Edition Ulcpc on an Asus netbook using a USB drive. You will need a USB drive with at least 4 GB of space, a Windows XP installation disc or ISO file, and a product key for Windows XP Home Edition Ulcpc. You will also need a computer with a CD/DVD drive or an ISO mounting software to create the USB boot disc.
 
## Step 1: Create a USB boot disc
 
The first step is to create a USB boot disc that contains the Windows XP installation files. To do this, you need to download the USB\_Multiboot\_10 application from [http://multiboot-usb.en.lo4d.com/](http://multiboot-usb.en.lo4d.com/) and unzip the files to your desired location. Then, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the USB\_MultiBoot\_10 folder and double click on USB\_MultiBoot\_10.cmd. A Command prompt box (cmd) will appear. Press any key to continue.
2. Format the USB drive. First, type H and an HP disk-storage format tool screen will open. Follow the instructions to format the USB drive. Make sure to check the Quick Format box. You can also format the USB drive using Windows FAT32 format if the program cannot find your USB stick.
3. On the command screen, change your drive type and give XP setup a source path. First, type 0 and press Enter so that USB Stick appears at the end of the line. Then, type 1 and press Enter and to select the Microsoft Windows XP path. (Browse to the CD drive or the path on the HDD where you have your XP installation files). If you receive a message about "winnt.sif," hit Yes.
4. On the Unattended Install screen, enter all the necessary values and your serial license key. If you fill out the fields now, Windows will not ask you for any information during the installation.
5. On the command screen, type 2, press Enter, and then select your USB drive.
6. Prepare the file copy from the disc to your USB stick. On the command screen, type 3 and press Enter; you will then see some files copying on the USB drive. If you are asked, "Copy XP and extra sources on the USB?", choose Yes. If choosing your USB drive while using Windows 7 prompts the message, "has not fat fat32 or ntfs format and is not valid", you need to open the USB\_MultiBoot\_10.cmd, search for VER | find "6.0." > nul, and change it to VER | find "6.1." > nul to reflect that you are running the script on Windows 7; fsutil should then recognize your drives correctly.
7. Copy the files from the disc to your USB stick. When you get the message, âFile Copy to USB-Drive is Ready - OK â Success,â press Yes (make USB-stick in XP setup to be preferred boot drive U:) and press any key.
